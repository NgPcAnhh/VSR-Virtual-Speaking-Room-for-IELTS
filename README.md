 It's a solution that saves time, effort, and manpower for the speaking practice phase, which normally requires an additional person to act as an examiner. Moreover, the app offers various modes such as full test practice or individual practice for part 1 or part 2+3. Therefore, the app is suitable for both beginners and experienced learners. The freedom to practice without limits helps learners improve their speaking skills significantly. 
 
*** Please note that the software does not have a grading function because computer cannot replace humans in grading speaking tests. For optimal learning and progress, it is recommended to use the recorded clips as materials for self-review or to seek feedback from more experienced individuals !!! 

Here is the youtube video of the practise test:

When running the application for the first time, the user must unlock it once to use it. Steps to follow: Use the command to look up the computer's serial number by pressing Windows + R, then enter "wmic bios get serialnumber" in the terminal. Next, search online for a method to decode Base64 and find the Base64 encoding of the machine. Enter this encoding into the unlocking interface. After that, you can use it normally in all subsequent uses.
