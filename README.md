 It's a solution that saves time, money, effort, and manpower for the speaking practice phase, which normally requires an additional person to act as an examiner. Moreover, the app offers various modes such as full test practice or individual practice for part 1 or part 2+3. Therefore, the app is suitable for both beginners and experienced learners. The freedom to practice without limits helps learners improve their speaking skills significantly. 
 
*** Please note that the software does not have a grading function because AI cannot replace humans in grading speaking tests. For optimal learning and progress, it is recommended to use the recorded clips as materials for self-review or to seek feedback from more experienced individuals !!!
